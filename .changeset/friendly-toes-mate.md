- Renamed a route definition `$name` option to `$id`.
- Renamed the `registerRoute` `$parentName` option to `$parentId`.

These changes should have been a major version but since Squide firefly v9 has been released a few days ago and no applications already migrated, it's include as part of v9 breaking changes.
