## Monorepo setup

This repository is managed as a monorepo with [PNPM workspace](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) to handle the installation of the npm dependencies and manage the packages interdependencies.

It's important to note that PNPM workspace doesn't hoist the npm dependencies at the root of the workspace as most package manager does. Instead, it uses an advanced [symlinked node_modules structure](https://pnpm.io/symlinked-node-modules-structure). This means that you'll find a `node_modules` directory inside the packages folders as well as at the root of the repository.

The main difference to account for is that the `devDependencies` must now be installed locally in every package `package.json` file rather than in the root `package.json` file.

### Turborepo

This repository use [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) to execute it's commands. Turborepo help saving time with it's built-in cache but also ensure the packages topological order is respected when executing commands.

To be understand the relationships between the commands, have a look at this repository [turbo.json](./turbo.json) configuration file.

### JIT packages

When possible, the packages and the sample applications' projects are configured for [JIT packages](https://www.shew.dev/monorepos/packaging/jit).

## Project overview

This project is split into three major sections, [packages/](packages/), [samples/](samples/) and [templates/](templates/).

### Packages

Under [packages/](packages/) are the actual packages composing the modular application shell.

### Samples

Under [samples/](samples/) are applications to test the Squide functionalities while developing.

You'll find four samples:

- `basic`: A sample application showcasing the basic features of Squide.
- `basic-wenpack`: A sample application showcasing the basic features of Squide using webpack as a bundle.
- `basic-mix`: A sample application showcasing the basic features of Squide using an rsbuild host application and webpack remote modules.
- `endpoints`: A more complexe sample application showcasing the different usecases related to data fetching and localization.

## Installation

This project uses PNPM, therefore, you must install [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation) v9+ first:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

To install the dependencies of this repository, open a terminal at the root of the workspace and execute the following command:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Setup Honeycomb

[Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io/) is one of the monitoring platforms used at Workleap. The [endpoints](./samples/endpoints/) sample application of this repository is already configured to send traces to Honeycomb but needs a valid Honeycomb API key.

First, create a file named `apikeys` at the root of [samples](./samples/endpoints/) folder.

``` !#3
workspace
├── samples
├──── apiKeys.js
```

Then, retrieve a valid [Honeycomb API Key](https://docs.honeycomb.io/get-started/configure/environments/manage-api-keys/) from your Vault (or ask IT a key for Honeycomb's "frontend-platform-team-dev" environment).

Finally, open the newly created `apiKeys.js` file and export an `HoneycombApiKey` constant with the API key as value.

```js samples/apiKeys.js
export const HoneycombApiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
```

If you don't have access to a Honeycomb API Key but still want to run the [endpoints](./samples/endpoints/) sample, create the `apiKeys.js` file as described above and set the `HoneycombApiKey` to an empty string.

```js samples/apiKeys.js
export const HoneycombApiKey = " ";
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `samples/endpoints/apiKeys.js` file is ignored by Git and will not be pushed to the remote repository.

### Setup Retype

[Retype](https://retype.com/) is the documentation platform that Squide is using for its documentation. As this project is leveraging a few [Pro features](https://retype.com/pro/) of Retype.

Everything should work fine as-is but there are a few limitations to use Retype Pro features without a wallet with a licence. If you want to circumvent these limitations, you can optionally, setup your [Retype wallet](https://retype.com/guides/cli/#retype-wallet).

To do so, first make sure that you retrieve the Retype license from your Vault (or ask IT).

Then, open a terminal at the root of the workspace and execute the following command:

```bash
npx retype wallet --add <your-license-key-here>
```

## Develop the packages

Open a [VSCode terminals](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics#_managing-multiple-terminals) and start one of the sample application with one of the following scripts:

```bash
pnpm dev-basic
```

or

```bash
pnpm dev-basic-webpack
```

or

```bash
pnpm dev-basic-mix
```

or

```bash
pnpm dev-endpoints
```

You can then open your favorite browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` to get a live preview of your code.

> To test that a remote module is working correctly, navigate to the remote module entry file. For a remote module hosted on the port `8081`, the URL should be `http://localhost:8081/remoteEntry.js`.

If you prefer to develop without a sample application, use the `dev-pkg` script instead:

```bash
pnpm dev-pkg
```

## Release the packages

When you are ready to release the packages, you must follow the following steps:

1. Run `pnpm changeset` and follow the prompt. For versioning, always follow the [SemVer standard](https://semver.org/).
2. Commit the newly generated file in your branch and submit a new Pull Request (PR). Changesets will automatically detect the changes and post a message in your pull request telling you that once the PR closes, the versions will be released.
3. Find someone to review your PR.
4. Merge the Pull request into `main`. A GitHub action will automatically trigger and update the version of the packages and publish them to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). A tag will also be created on GitHub tagging your PR merge commit.

### Troubleshooting

#### Github

Make sure you're Git is clean (No pending changes).

#### NPM

Make sure GitHub Action has **write access** to the selected npm packages.

#### Compilation

If the packages failed to compile, it's easier to debug without executing the full release flow every time. To do so, instead, execute the following command:

```bash
pnpm build-pkg
```

By default, packages compilation output will be in their respective *dist* directory.

#### Linting errors

If you got linting error, most of the time, they can be fixed automatically using `eslint . --fix`, if not, follow the report provided by `pnpm lint`.

## Deploy the sample applications

### The "basic" sample application

The sites for this sample application are hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/):

- [host](https://squide-basic-host.netlify.app/)
- [remote-module](https://squide-basic-remote-module.netlify.app)
- [another-remote-module](https://squide-basic-another-remote-module.netlify.app)

To deploy the sample application, open a terminal at the root of the repository and execute the following script:

```bash
pnpm deploy-basic
```

A prompt with a few questions will appear and then the site will automatically be deployed to production.

### The sample application with "endpoints"

The sites for this sample application are hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/):

- [host](https://squide-endpoints-host.netlify.app/)
- [remote-module](https://squide-endpoints-remote-module.netlify.app)
- [remote-module (isolated)](https://squide-endpoints-remote-isolated.netlify.app/)

To deploy the sample application, open a terminal at the root of the repository and execute the following script:

```bash
pnpm deploy-endpoints
```

A prompt with a few questions will appear and then the sites will automatically be deployed to production.

Then, execute the following script:

```bash
pnpm deploy-endpoints-isolated
```

Another prompt with a few questions will appear and then the sites will automatically be deployed to production.

## CI

We use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for this repository.

You can find the configuration in the [.github/workflows](.github/workflows/) folder and the build results are available [here](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/wl-squide/actions).

We currently have 3 builds configured:

### Changesets

This action runs on a push on the `main` branch. If there is a file present in the `.changeset` folder, it will publish the new package version on npm.

### CI

This action will trigger when a commit is done in a PR to `main` or after a push to `main` and will run `build-pkg`, `build-basic`, `build-basic-webpack`, `build-basic-mix`, `build-endpoints`, `lint` and `test` commands on the source code.

### Retype

This action will trigger when a commit is done in a PR to `main` or after a push to `main`. The action will generate the documentation website into the `retype` branch. This repository [Github Pages](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/wl-web-configs/settings/pages) is configured to automatically deploy the website from the `retype` branch.

If you are having issue with the Retype license, make sure the `RETYPE_API_KEY` Github secret contains a valid Retype license.

## Add a new package to the monorepo

There are a few steps to add new packages to the monorepo.

Before you add a new package, please read the [Workleap GitHub guidelines](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/github-guidelines#npm-package-name).

### Create the package

First, create a new folder matching the package name in the [packages](/packages) folder.

Open a terminal, navigate to the newly created folder, and execute the following command:

```bash
pnpm init
```

Answer the CLI questions.

Once the `package.json` file is generated, please read again the [Workleap GitHub guidelines](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/github-guidelines#npm-package-name) and make sure the package name, author and license are valid.

Don't forget to add the [npm scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-scopes) `"@squide"` before the package name. For example, if the project name is "foo", your package name should be `@squide/foo`.

Make sure the package publish access is *public* by adding the following to the `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  }
}
```

### sideEffects

Make sure to add a `sideEffect` field to the `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "sideEffects": false
}
```

Most of the time, the value will be `false` but if your package contains CSS or any other [side effect](https://sgom.es/posts/2020-06-15-everything-you-never-wanted-to-know-about-side-effects/), make sure to set the value accordingly.

### Dependencies

npm *dependencies* and *peerDependencies* must be added to the package own *package.json* file.
