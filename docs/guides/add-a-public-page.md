# Add a public page

When an application is using the [AppRouter]() component, by default, a [registered route]() is considered a protected. This means that it will trigger the load of the initial protected when a user navigate to this route for the time.

-> Also mention that it has nothing to do with the authentication boundary (maybe the name should be changed from $visibility to something more related to fetching initial data?!?!)
