# Isolate module failures

One of the key characteristics of micro-frontends implementations like [iframes](https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html#Run-timeIntegrationViaIframes) and subdomains is the ability to isolate failures within individual modules, preventing them from breaking the entire application.

However, with a [Module Federation](https://module-federation.io/) implementation, this is not the case as all the modules share the same browsing context (e.g. the same [Document object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document), the same [Window object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window), and the same DOM). A failure in one module can potentially breaks the entire application.

Nevertheless, an application, federated or non-federated, can get very close to iframes failure isolation by utilizing React Router's [Outlet](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/outlet) component and the [errorElement](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/error-element) property of a React Router's routes.

## Create an error boundary

First, define a React Router's error boundary to catch module errors. For this example we'll name it `ModuleErrorBoundary`:

```tsx host/src/ModuleErrorBoundary.tsx
export function ModuleErrorBoundary() {
    return (
        <div>An error occured while rendering a page from a module!</div>
    )
}
```

## Register the error boundary

Then, update the host application `registerHost` function to declare the `ModuleErrorBoundary` component below the `RootLayout` component but above the routes of the modules. By doing so, if a module encounters an unhandled error, the error boundary will only replace the section rendered by the `Outlet` component within the root layout rather than the entire page.

A React Router's error boundary is declared with the [errorElement](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/error-element) of a route:

```tsx !#7,11 host/src/register.tsx
import { PublicRoutes, ProtectedRoutes, type ModuleRegisterFunction, type FireflyRuntime } from "@squide/firefly";
import { RootLayout } from "./RootLayout.tsx";
import { ModuleErrorBoundary } from "./ModuleErrorBoundary.tsx";

export const registerHost: ModuleRegisterFunction<FireflyRuntime> = runtime => {
    runtime.registerRoute({
        element: <RootLayout />,
        children: [
            {
                // Error boundary for modules.
                errorElement: <ModuleErrorBoundary />,
                children: [
                    PublicRoutes,
                    ProtectedRoutes
                ]
            }
        ]
    }, {
        hoist: true
    });
};
```

By implementing this mechanism, the level of failure isolation achieved is **comparable** to that of an **iframes** or **subdomains** implementation. With this mechanism, failure isolation **is as good as** with an **iframes** or **subdomains** implementation.

### Hoisted pages

If your application is [hoisting pages](../reference/runtime/runtime-class.md#register-an-hoisted-route), it's important to note that they will be rendered outside of the host application's `ModuleErrorBoundary` component. To prevent breaking the entire application when an hoisted page encounters unhandled errors, it is highly recommended to declare a React Router's error boundary for each hoisted page as well, again using [errorElement](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/error-element):

```tsx !#9,11 remote-module/src/register.tsx
import { type ModuleRegisterFunction, type FireflyRuntime } from "@squide/firefly";
import { Page } from "./Page.tsx";
import { RemoteErrorBoundary } from "./RemoteErrorBoundary.tsx";

export const register: ModuleRegisterFunction<FireflyRuntime> = runtime => {
    runtime.registerRoute({
        path: "remote/page", 
        element: <Page />,
        errorElement: <RemoteErrorBoundary />
    }, {
        hoist: true
    });
};
```

## Try it :rocket:

Start the application in a development environment using the `dev` script. Update any of your application routes that is rendered under the newly created error boundary (e.g. that is not hoisted) and throw an `Error`. The error should be handled by the `ModuleErrorBoundary` component instead of breaking the whole application.

### Troubleshoot issues

If you are experiencing issues with this guide:

- Open the [DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) console. You'll find a log entry for each registration that occurs and error messages if something went wrong.
- Refer to a working example on [GitHub](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/wl-squide/tree/main/samples/basic/shell).
- Refer to the [troubleshooting](../troubleshooting.md) page.
