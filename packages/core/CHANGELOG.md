## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#182](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/wl-squide/pull/182) [`58cf066`](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/wl-squide/commit/58cf066e87e23611510c254cca96016bd2bad08a) Thanks [@patricklafrance](https://github.com/patricklafrance)! - ## Firefly v9

  This major version of @squide/firefly introduces TanStack Query as the official library for fetching the global data of a Squide's application and features a complete rewrite of the AppRouter component, which now uses a state machine to manage the application's bootstrapping flow.

  Prior to v9, Squide applications couldn't use TanStack Query to fetch global data, making it challenging for Workleap's applications to keep their global data in sync with the server state. With v9, applications can now leverage custom wrappers of the useQueries hook to fetch and keep their global data up-to-date with the server state. Additionally, the new deferred registrations update feature allows applications to even keep their conditional navigation items in sync with the server state.

  Finally, with v9, Squide's philosophy has evolved. We used to describe Squide as a shell for federated applications. Now, we refer to Squide as a shell for modular applications. After playing with Squide's local module feature for a while, we discovered that Squide offers significant value even for non-federated applications, which triggered this shift in philosophy.

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#168](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/wl-squide/pull/168) [`89ace29`](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/wl-squide/commit/89ace29b9aeadbbe83cfa71dd137b9f1a115c283) Thanks [@patricklafrance](https://github.com/patricklafrance)! - This release Migrates Squide from Webpack Module Federation to [Module Federation 2.0](https://module-federation.io/guide/start/quick-start.html).

  This release deprecates the following packages:

  - `@squide/webpack-module-federation`, use `@squide/module-federation` instead.
  - `@squide/firefly-configs`, use `@squide/firefly-webpack-configs` instead.

  And introduce a few changes to existing API:

  - The `FireflyRuntime` nows accept a `useMsw` option and expose a new `isMswEnabled` getter:

  ```ts
  // bootstrap.tsx

  import { FireflyRuntime } from "@squide/firefly";

  const runtime = new FireflyRuntime({
    useMsw: true,
  });

  // Use the runtime to determine if MSW handlers should be registered.
  if (runtime.isMswEnabled) {
    // ...
  }
  ```

  - The `registerRemoteModules` function doesn't accept the remotes URL anymore. The remotes URL should be configured in the webpack configuration files.

  Previously:

  ```ts
  // bootstrap.tsx

  import {
    registerRemoteModules,
    type RemoteDefinition,
  } from "@squide/firefly";

  const Remotes: RemoteDefinition = [
    {
      name: "remote1",
      url: "http://localhost:8081",
    },
  ];

  await registerRemoteModules(Remotes, runtime);
  ```

  ```js
  // webpack.dev.js

  import { defineDevHostConfig } from "@squide/firefly-webpack-configs";
  import { swcConfig } from "./swc.dev.js";

  export default defineDevHostConfig(swcConfig, 8080, {
    overlay: false,
  });
  ```

  Now:

  ```ts
  // bootstrap.tsx

  import {
    registerRemoteModules,
    type RemoteDefinition,
  } from "@squide/firefly";

  const Remotes: RemoteDefinition = [
    {
      name: "remote1",
    },
  ];

  await registerRemoteModules(Remotes, runtime);
  ```

  ```js
  // webpack.dev.js

  import { defineDevHostConfig } from "@squide/firefly-webpack-configs";
  import { swcConfig } from "./swc.dev.js";

  /**
   * @typedef {import("@squide/firefly-webpack-configs").RemoteDefinition}[]
   */
  export const Remotes = [
    {
      name: "remote1",
      url: "http://localhost:8081",
    },
  ];

  export default defineDevHostConfig(swcConfig, 8080, Remotes, {
    overlay: false,
  });
  ```

  To migrate:

  1. Replace the `@squide/webpack-module-federation` dependency by `@squide/module-federation`.

  2. Replace the `@squide/firefly-configs` dependency by `@squide/firefly-webpack-configs`.

  3. Move the remotes URL from the `bootstrap.tsx` file to the `webpack.*.js` files.

  4. Integrate the new `useMsw` and `isMswEnabled` props.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#93](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/wl-squide/pull/93) [`d66a196`](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/wl-squide/commit/d66a196db9346803e1c996ef64089eda9aeff180) Thanks [@patricklafrance](https://github.com/patricklafrance)! - ### Addition

  - Added support for plugins to Squide runtime.
  - Added a `parentName` option to `registerRoute`.

  ### Updated

  - The `layoutPath` option of `registerRoute` has been renamed to `parentPath`.
  - `registerNavigationItems` has been renamed to `registerNavigationItem` and now only accepts a single item by call.
  - A navigation item `label`, `additionalProps` and `priority` fields has been renamed to `$label`, `$additionalProps` and `$priority`. This is part of an effort to ensure no future release of [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) introduced new properties with names that are conflicting with Squide.
  - Local modules `register` function can now be `async`. This is useful if you want for example to conditionally to a dynamic `import` to load a dependency such as [msw](https://www.npmjs.com/package/msw).

  ### Removed

  - Removed the Service features at it was confusing and not that helpful. We recommend using React context instead to share services with the modules.
