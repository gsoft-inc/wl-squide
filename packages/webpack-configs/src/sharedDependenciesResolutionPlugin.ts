/*
This custom share dependency resolution strategy ensure that only the host app can ask for a new major version of a library.
Otherwise, any remote can request for an higher non-major version.

Examples:

host:        2.0
remote-1:    2.1   <-----
remote-2:    2.0

host:        2.0   <-----
remote-1:    3.1
remote-2:    2.0

host:        2.0
remote-1:    3.1
remote-2:    2.1   <-----

host:       >2.0
remote-1:    3.1
remote-2:    2.1   <-----
