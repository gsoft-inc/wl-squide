[[{"l":"Getting started","p":["Welcome to @squide(yes \uD83E\uDD91 with an \"e\"), a shell for Workleap federated applications. In this getting started section, you'll find an overview of the shell and a quick start guide to create a new federated application from scratch.","The prefered way for creating a new federated application for the Workleap's platform is with the foundry-cli."]},{"l":"Why","p":["We have built this shell to facilitate the adoption of federated applications at Workleap by enforcing patterns that we believe will help feature teams successfully implement a distributed architecture.","The shell itself is a lightweight API layer built on top of Module Federation and React Router, with the goal of maximizing the strength of both libraries while interfering as little as possible with their functionality."]},{"l":"Module Federation","p":["We have identified 2 major challenges with frontend federated applications:","How can we prevent loading the same large dependencies twice when switching between modules?","How can we offer a cohesive experience that doesn't feel modular?","To address the first challenge, we believe that Module Federation provides a solution by offering a mecanism capable of deduping common dependencies shared between the host application and the remote modules at runtime.","With this mecanism in place, all federated parts of an application can now be loaded in the same browsing context instead of nested browsing contexts such as iframes.","By sharing the same browsing context (e.g. the same Document object, the same Window object, and the same DOM), federated parts now form a unified and cohesive single application, addressing the second challenge.","With Module Federation, we hope to develop federated applications that provide the same user experience as monolithic applications \uD83D\uDE80."]},{"l":"React Router","p":["React Router nested routes feature is ideal for federated applications as it enables highly composable and decoupled UI. For a more in-depth explanation, refer to this article."]},{"l":"Module registration","p":["The most distinctive aspect of this shell is the conventions it enforces for loading and registering remote modules. Here's a brief overview of the flow:","During bootstrap, the host application attempts to load predefined modules and calls a registration function with a specific name and signature for each successfully loaded module.","During registration, a module receives the shared services of the federation application and use them to dynamically register its routes and navigation items.","Once all the modules are registered, the host application will create a React Router instance with the registered routes and renders a navigation menu with the registered navigation items.","That's a nutshell overview. Of course, there is more to it, but these are the main ideas."]},{"l":"Guiding principles","p":["While developing the API of @squide, we kept a few guiding principles in mind. Those principles are not settled stones, you might want to diverge from them from time to time, but adhering to those will make your experience more enjoyable:","A module should always correspond to a subdomain of the application's business domain and should only export pages.","A module should be fully autonomous. It shouldn't have to coordinate with other parts of the application for things as trivial as navigation links.","A federated application should feel cohesive. Different parts of a federation application should have the ability to communicate with each others and react to changes happening outside of their boundaries.","Data and state should never be shared between parts of a federated application. Even if two parts require the same data or the same state values, they should load, store and manage them independently."]},{"l":"Limitations","p":["Module Federation comes with a few manageable limitations that are important to consider when architecting your distributed application:","A shared dependency cannot be tree-shaken. Since remote modules are loaded at runtime, ModuleFederationPlugin cannot infer which parts of a shared dependency will be used by the application modules. Therefore, tree-shaking is disabled for shared dependencies.","Module Federation does not support React Fast Refresh. However, it does support Hot Module Replacement.","These limitations are not specific to @squide, they are specific to Module Federation."]},{"l":"Create your project","p":["To get started, follow the quick start guide to create a new federated application from scratch."]}],[{"l":"Create an host application","p":["Let's begin by creating the application that will serve as the entry point for our federated application and host the application modules."]},{"l":"Install the packages","p":["Create a new application (we'll refer to ours as host), then open a terminal at the root of the new solution and install the following packages:","While you can use any package manager to develop an application with @squide, it is highly recommended that you use PNPM as the following guide has been developed and tested with PNPM."]},{"l":"Setup the application"},{"l":"Create the new files","p":["First, create the following files:"]},{"l":"ESM syntax","p":["Then, ensure that you are developing your application using ESM syntax by specifying type: module in your package.json file:"]},{"l":"Async boundary","p":["Then, use a dynamic import to add an async boundary:","To learn more about this async boundary and the bootstrap.tsx file, read the following article."]},{"l":"Module registration","p":["Then, instanciate the shell Runtime and register the remote module(the configuration of the remote module will be covered in the next section):"]},{"l":"Router instance","p":["Then, retrieve the routes that have been registered by the remote module and create a router instance:","And finally, create the Home component:"]},{"l":"Navigation items","p":["FInally, create a layout component to render the navigation items:"]},{"l":"Configure webpack","p":["@squide webpack configuration is built on top of @workleap/webpack-configs, @workleap/browserslist-config and @workleap/swc-configs.
